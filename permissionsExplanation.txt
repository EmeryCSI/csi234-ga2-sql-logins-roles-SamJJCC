1.
Select: Allows reading data
Insert:Allows adding new rows
Update:allows modifying existing data
Delete:allows removing rows

2: schema level permissions are when users have read access to all tables in a schema , and table level permissions are when
they have access to a specific table.

3: column permissions allow for more specific columns permisions. Like the IT example where 
They are allowed to update employee info except for Salary in the employee Data table

4: the principle of least privilege is only granting users permission they absolutley need. That means users can 
only access information that they absolutley need and have less access to sensitive information. In this guided activity, we are granting users access 
based on their roles and we see what certain users have access to. Some users have more access to data than others, Like HR has a lot of access and some users only have read only access.


5:It is better to use roles because you are able to give permissions based on said role. Once roles are created and given permissions, you can give users a role and it would be easier to 
update roles too.
